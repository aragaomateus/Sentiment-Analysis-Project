<p>Normal or gaussian distribution is the most common distribution that arises in nature and the necessary conditions for a normal distribution to occur is that the events need to be independent and there needs to be an abundance of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned in the lecture that iq among the general population is a normal distribution, but many correlated factors relate to one's iq, so how is it still normal distribution if the factors are not independent?&nbsp;</p>
