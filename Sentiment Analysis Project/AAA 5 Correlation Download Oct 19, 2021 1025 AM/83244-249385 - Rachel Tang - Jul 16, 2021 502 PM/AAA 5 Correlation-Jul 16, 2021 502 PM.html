<p>One big thing I took away from the class was that the normal distribution is common in nature because it is made up of many, many factors that combine independently. This is why the normal distribution often doesn't fit social phenomena very well. I've only learned about the normal distribution in my statistics classes for psychology, so it did not occur to me that there were other types of distributions that might be more appropriate for real-world situations.</p>
<p>I think I would appreciate another walkthrough of the equations and what each part means. I'm having trouble understanding the logic of the parts and how they fit together (ex: why is the variance the standard deviation but squared?).</p>
