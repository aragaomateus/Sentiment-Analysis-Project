<p>The lecture part talks about "correlation", especially normal distribution and covariance. Normal distribution is common in daily life and and crucial in statistics, and it seems to be a magic function that given by the nature. Covariance is something I have heard a lot but never know how really works. It's more useful than I imagined. Correlation is important when describing relationships while correlation doesn't mean causation: there's the third variable that affects both. It's a challenge to the intuition and logic. The python part (lab) helps me know more efficient ways to obtain the mathematics goals. (but...)</p>
<p>When we know correlation isn't necessary causation...how can we really tell "causation"? When the two objects are correlated each other, and intuitively seem to be "cause" and "effect", how can we surely say one causes the other? Besides, I don't know whether it's my laptop's problem but python seems to be too jamming. It takes me far more time than needed to run a code.</p>
