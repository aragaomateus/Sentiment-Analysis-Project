<p>1) I used to think correlation is a simple, easy point to interpret, yet now I'm aware that even The New York Times assume correlation as causality. Correlation, relationship, linear distribution... they are different in ideology even though they seem to be the same. The problem can be really tricky sometimes and I will exam every article/paper I read from now on based on this new insight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) For the lab, I'm struggling to visualize the array with 1000 rows and 30 columns after the code done the simulation process. Is there any chance that you can provide a gif containing the process of this code? Thank you!</p>
