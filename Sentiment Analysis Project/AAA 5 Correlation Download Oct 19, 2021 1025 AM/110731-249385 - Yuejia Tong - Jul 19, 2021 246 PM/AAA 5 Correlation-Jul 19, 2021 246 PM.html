<p>The main takeaway for this lecture for me is the introduction on normal distributions: the necessary conditions for a normal distribution to occur, and some real life examples of normal distributions.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the illustration of normal distribution as a physical manifestation: the drop ball example. Since I never heard of that there is a "coincidence" that conceptually explains the prevalence of normal distributions.</p>
