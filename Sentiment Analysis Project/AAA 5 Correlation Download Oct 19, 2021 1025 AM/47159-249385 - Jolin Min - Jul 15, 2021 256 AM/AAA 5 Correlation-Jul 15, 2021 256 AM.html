<p>1) It's definitely very fascinating, for all things we covered today during the lab. I found it so convenient and amazing to use codes and be able to calculate chords of descriptive statistics using python. I especially like the part where we learned codes about vector, unit vector, and scaled vector, because it's useful and intuitive. I also like how we can proceed simulations in loops. For the lecture, we learned that normal distribution is the "most common" distribution in nature; however, I'm wondering when normal distribution is not so useful in modeling distribution&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;is it when the distributions are too skewed? Is there any other exception?</p>
<p>2) I want to see the applications of normal distribution in real life&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;I once encountered an application of normal distribution in IQ scores and found it very fascinating. In particular, in areas like health and stock market?&nbsp;</p>
