<p>1) My main takeaway from this class session is an understanding of correlation, not only through an English definition but through a mathematical expression. Correlation is a parameter that describes how two variables are related to each other. In terms of math, correlation is normalized covariance, or the covariance divided by the product of the variables' respective standard deviations. Two important points about correlation is that it describes the strength of linear relationships, and that it does not establish causation.</p>
<p>2) I would like to learn more about aleatory calculations. I think I need to understand better how they work and how they are used to interpret the strength of the correlation between variables. I would also like to learn more about the processes we can use to go from establishing correlation to being able to reasonably suggest causation. I would like to learn about experimental designs that allow us to do this, and what some of the challenges might be.</p>
