<p>1. The main takeaway from this lecture was the information about normal distribution and definitely the coding lesson about matrices. It's interesting to see all the concepts from statistics being applied to a coding environment and how we can use these mathematical formulas and logic to create plots through code. I find it very interesting to see how the code comes together and how we can predict/make models about the information given using code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I would like to know more about how we can analyze stock data using distributions and matrices. An important aspect and implementation of the data science principles can be applied to market moves and actions, I wish to be able to create models using the mathematical concepts learned in class. The derivation for the normal distribution charts and graphs surprised me because I never knew where it was derived from before now, only how to use the mathematical formulas like z score and confidence intervals prior to this. The pascal's triangle diagram was insightful.</p>
