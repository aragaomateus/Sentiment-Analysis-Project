<p>The scatterplots in this lecture remind me of the game I played last year - looking at the randomly generated scatterplot and determine the correlation. It took me a weekend to get 100 points because once you give the wrong answer you have to start over again and again. Just like last lecture, this time I review the concepts I have been using for a long time and gain a deeper understanding of them. I learnt how correlation derives from a distribution and reviewed its properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far we have covered a lot in this class. I wonder if we can have more examples in class, not just how others apply similar technique in their work, but how we can apply what we learn in solving some basic problems. (especially how we can use matrix to solve problems)</p>
