<p>I learn about t<span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">he&nbsp;arithmetic&nbsp;mean and how it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">Is a measure of central tendency. I also lean that we could use t</span><span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">he sum of deviations and the s</span><span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">um of squared&nbsp;</span>deviation<span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">&nbsp;as</span><span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">&nbsp;useful ways to determine the actual value of a natural process from measurements contaminated by random variability. If there is outliners,</span><span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">&nbsp;the mean is affected quite dramatically and we could get a&nbsp;</span>wrong interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested in the topic of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">fMRI. I think it is great to association&nbsp;</span>neutral activities with central tendency. I wonder what would we focus on the most when looking at tendency in the <span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">&nbsp;</span>neutral activities.</p>
