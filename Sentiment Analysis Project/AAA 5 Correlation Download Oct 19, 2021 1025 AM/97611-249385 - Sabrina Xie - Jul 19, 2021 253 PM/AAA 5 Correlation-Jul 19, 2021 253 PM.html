<p>1) The main takeaway I got is that understanding correlation is important because relationships between variables are one of the core parts of science. We have to be careful in assessing if our data qualifies for a certain type of distribution too because if we assume that it fits a distribution that it actually doesn't, then it could lead to incorrect conclusions. Correlation also becomes increasingly important as the dataset becomes bigger.</p>
<p>2) I want to learn more about the phenomenons/effects mentioned in this lecture; I feel like this lecture introduced the most amount of new effects such as the Matthew effect and the Lollapalooza effect. I think these concepts are interesting because they are just intriguing properties themselves and are also important to consider when discussing data and statistics in general. They're not core parts of a curriculum but are general knowledge that will help us be better data scientists.</p>
