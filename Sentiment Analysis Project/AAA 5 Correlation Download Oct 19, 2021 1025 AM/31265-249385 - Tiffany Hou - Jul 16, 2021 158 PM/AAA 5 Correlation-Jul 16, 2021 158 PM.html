Seeing mean, SD, matrices, etc all coming together in a function and the ideas behind them is just satisfying and I feel like I know how to study this class better and is very interested in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

I found the plotting part a bit confusing but also fascinating at the same time since I haven&rsquo;t had too much experiences with plotting in python yet.</span></p>
