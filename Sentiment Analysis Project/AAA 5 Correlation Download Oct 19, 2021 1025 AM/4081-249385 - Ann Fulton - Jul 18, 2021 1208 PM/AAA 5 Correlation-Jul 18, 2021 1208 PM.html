<p>1) My main takeaway is that correlation is deeply important because understanding relationships and how things change or don't change in relation to each other is the foundation of data science. I also took away that in the real world, correlation can often be conflated with causation, and many many variables can be at play to create certain phenomenon.</p>
<p>2) I'd like to know more about the aleatory calculations section. We briefly went over it, but it seemed really interesting and helped me understand the concept more. I was also surprised about the process of deriving covariance and it provided an interesting insight into the math aspect of what we are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
