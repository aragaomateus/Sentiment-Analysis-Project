<p>1. The most notable thing I learned from this class is the derivation of the normal distribution. I like the animation of several coins dropping from the center of the top and passing through the board. This example illustrates the mathematical proof behind the normal distribution and its relationship to the pascal triangle. Moreover, the mathematical demonstration of the formula of correlation also told me why people used correlation to measure the relationship.</p>
<p>2. As mentioned in the lecture, the normal distribution is used in many fields such as physics and biology. I really want to see specifically how the normal distribution is utilized by researchers to solve physics and biology problems to better appreciate the importance of the normal distribution.</p>
