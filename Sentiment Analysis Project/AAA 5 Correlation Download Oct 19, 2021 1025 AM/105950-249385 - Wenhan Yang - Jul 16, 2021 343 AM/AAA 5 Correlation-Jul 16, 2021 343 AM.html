<p>1) Correlation, derived from normalizing covariance with products of respective standard deviations, measures the strength of linear relation between variables, and direction of the relation is also given(positive or negative). It is unit-less, so one can compare across the correlations of different sets of variables in a dataset. Note that correlation doesn't imply causality--deciding causality is much harder and requires experiments--even when the correlation is perfect(abs value = 1). There might be a third variable that confound the causation of that two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As correlation only measures the linear relation strength, does the correlation of 0 mean that there is not linear relation but maybe other kind of relation, e.g. quadratic, logarithmic... ? Are there any parameters to be calculated for those kind of relation? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
