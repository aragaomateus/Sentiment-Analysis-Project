<p>1.) One takeaway from this class is that I could now differentiate correlation and covariance - before I confused between the two, but now I know covariance gives more of a direction of the relationship between two variables rather than a quantitative quality, whereas correlation provides a meaningful number through a unitless scale that allows us to interpret the power of the relationship.&nbsp;</p>
