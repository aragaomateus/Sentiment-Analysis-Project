<p>1) Deriving all the statistics stuffs will forever be tedious to me. I've also learned most of this before, and I've struggled with it every time, at least conceptually. The derivation is always useful but I always wind up forgetting something a while later. Nothing a google search can't solve, but this has always been sort of a weak point for me. The matrix thing was new, sort of confusing the first time around, but whatever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I've always wanted to find a solid intuition of exactly how all of these things (r, corr, etc.), but for various reasons never had the time to really immerse myself in understanding it. I tend to understand how to use things after I understand exactly how it works, so it's definitely something I want to look more into in the future.&nbsp;</p>
