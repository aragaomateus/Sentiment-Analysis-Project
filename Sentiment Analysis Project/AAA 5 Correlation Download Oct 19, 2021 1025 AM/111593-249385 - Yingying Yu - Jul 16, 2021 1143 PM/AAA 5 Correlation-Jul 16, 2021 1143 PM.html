<p>The main takeaways from this session are the following: 1) Covariance depends on units, and dividing the product of SDs of x and y can help get rid of the units; 2) Correlation only captures linear relations, and there are other methods to present other relations (such as sine); and 3) Normal distribution is hardly the perfect model of subjects other than Physics and Chemistry.</p>
<p>The "data cloud" characterized by the covariance reminds me of the heatmap, is it depends on the covariance of two variable? are we going to talk about heatmap?</p>
