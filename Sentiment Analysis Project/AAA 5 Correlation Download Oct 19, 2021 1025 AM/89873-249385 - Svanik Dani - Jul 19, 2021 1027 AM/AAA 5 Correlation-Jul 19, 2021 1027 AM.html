<p>1) State the main *takeaway* from this class session in your own words. Note: This is not a summary. I know what I talked about. I want to know - in *your* words (paraphrased) - what *you* took from it, so I can assess two things: a) "What resonated with you?" b) "Did you get it?" 1 paragraph. Keep it brief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that resonated with me was how correlation and a deterministic relationship between variables is not the same. The sin and circle graphs show clear deterministic relationships between variables, but have 0 correlation. Furthermore, the idea of correlation not being causation made sense to me - I got it. The example of autism and organic food sales really drove this idea home. Confounding variables further drove home the idea that causation and correlation are no the same, so it is critical to understand how to ask questions about the data and if the correlation logically could be a causal relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) What would you like to know more about? This can be anything (material that you didn't understand well the first time around or new information that we didn't get to, but wish we had). If nothing: What surprised you? 1 paragraph. Keep it brief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to know more about modeling and finding deterministic relationships that are non-linear and not clear through correlation. For example, we can easily model the circle or sin relationships but correlation would not tell us this. Is there some other statistical measure for us to see if there is some clear deterministic relationship between variables? How can we model and analyze the strength of these relationships? Furthermore, I'm interested in how high noise to signal ratio changes the usefulness of correlation as finance has a high noise to signal ratio not often found in other areas where statistics is applied.&nbsp;</p>
