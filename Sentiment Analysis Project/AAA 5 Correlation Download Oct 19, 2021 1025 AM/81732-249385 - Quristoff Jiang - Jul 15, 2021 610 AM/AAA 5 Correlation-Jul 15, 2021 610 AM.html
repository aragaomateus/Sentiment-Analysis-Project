<p>1) I understand what is normal distributions and how it provides us with information when determining something is distributed normally, as well as its required assumptions. I learn how covariance and correlation can be derived from standard deviation (especially in a Linear Algebra perspective), and why correlation should not be considered as causation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) What does matrix M specify in the linear algebra interpretation of covariance? Also, what does the gear example of aleatory calculation mean? Why correlation is not equal to 0 when respinning part but not all of the gears?&nbsp;</p>
