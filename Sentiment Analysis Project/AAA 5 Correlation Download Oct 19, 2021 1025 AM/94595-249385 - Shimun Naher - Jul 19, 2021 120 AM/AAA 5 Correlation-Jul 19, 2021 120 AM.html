<p>1. To summarize relationships with correlations we can use a normal distribution. A normal distribution results from having many factors combining independently. To derive correlation, we must begin with a distribution, find the standard distribution, convert to variance, convert to covariance, and then convert to correlation. The covariance characterizes the shape of a data cloud. A correlation can be thought of as a normalized covariance because it is normalized by the respective standard deviations. The correlation is represented by a single number that quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I liked that at today's lecture we started with lab first. I think it helped with timing the lecture and keeping myself and maybe others more attentive throughout the lecture. It was interesting to learn about how correlation is derived. I don't have any suggestions for today's lecture.&nbsp;</p>
