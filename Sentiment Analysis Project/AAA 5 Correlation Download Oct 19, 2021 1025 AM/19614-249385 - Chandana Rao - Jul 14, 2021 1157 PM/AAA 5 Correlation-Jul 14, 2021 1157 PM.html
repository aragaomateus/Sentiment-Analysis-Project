<p>1. Looked at how correlation is derived from standard deviation and, consequently, what it means for two variables to vary alongside each other. Also looked at the different properties associated with it and how to interpret it in context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I was surprised by the 'switch' that occurred when rewriting the standard deviation as covariance. Initially, I couldn't see what standard deviation had to do with correlation. When Pascal reframed variance as the idea of x varying with itself and, consequently, switched one of the terms with y(i) - y(mean) it became obvious. Said 'Ohhhh' out loud. It clicked.&nbsp;</p>
