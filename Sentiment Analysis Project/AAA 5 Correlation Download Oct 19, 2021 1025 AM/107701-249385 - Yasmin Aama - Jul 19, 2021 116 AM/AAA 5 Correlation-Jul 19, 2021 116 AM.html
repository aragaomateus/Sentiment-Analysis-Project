<p>I enjoyed the visualisation of the normal distribution with the Galton board. In the Galton board we were able to see that the pegs needed to combine independently and that there needed to be lots of pegs. But I am also wondering like, there also needed to be a lot of balls for the normal distribution to also come about surely because if there were 10 we might not have been able to see the distribution shape clearly. I also liked when you spoke about the human affairs example, and just to clarify I just wanted to make sure that you were saying human affairs do not follow a normal distribution because the events are no longer independent and we were able to see this through the Matthew effect. Another key takeaway is that if we knew a distribution is a normal distribution, then we know a lot of information b/c extreme outcomes are very unlikely (they are multiple standard deviations away).&nbsp; Mentioning the Q-score distribution was an interesting way to illustrate that not all distributions have a high probability at their mean. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another takeaway within this lecture is that 2 positively correlated variables don&rsquo;t imply causation because there can be a confounding variable or variables that is the cause for the correlations. This can be illustrated in the living by museums &amp; water example. Where the misinterpretation of correlation occurred.&nbsp; I enjoyed the linear algebra path to covariance. It was interesting to see how the matrix M just needed to be a matrix with two vectors of the same length for the covariance matrix to turn 2x2.</p>

<p>I was wondering if we could review why we needed to normalise the product of the stand deviations, I&rsquo;m not sure I entirely understood why the magnitude was not interpretable beforehand. I was also wondering if we could review the data cloud slide. I wasn&rsquo;t particularly sure as to why the diagonal quadrants (going from the bottom left quadrant to the top right quadrant) were positively correlated, while the other 2 were negatively correlated.</p>
