<p>What I took from this lecture of correlation is how we compute it and the logic behind the mathematical computation. Besides, I really appreciate how Pascal using linear algebra perspective to explain covariance and correlation.</p>
<p>I still have one question regarding the linear algebra interpretation of correlation: what role does standardization play in this process (in a high dimensional space)?&nbsp; Does it mean that through standardization, we can "correlate" all the numbers from different dimensions in a same unit?</p>
