<p>I really liked the gears example to understand correlations. I always felt that I sort of knew how correlations worked but I never &lsquo;knew&rsquo; knew the reasoning behind how they were interpreted. I found the integration of matrices into correlation very interesting, it helped out into context some of the linear algebra concepts we learnt, although I&rsquo;m still not 100% sure of why (and how) we calculated correlation using matrices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a little intrigued by the scatterplots you showed to explain how correlation captures the strength of linear relations specially. Would be interesting to know if there was some metric to capture the strength of non-linear relationships too.&nbsp;</p>
