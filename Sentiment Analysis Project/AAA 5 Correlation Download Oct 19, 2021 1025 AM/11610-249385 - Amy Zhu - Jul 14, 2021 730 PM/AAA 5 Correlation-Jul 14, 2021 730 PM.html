<p>1. The main takeaway I had from this class session was learning how normal distributions come to be. I especially liked the peg game simulation and Pascal's triangle explanation for understanding why normal distributions tend to happen. I also enjoyed the lab session where we could see the importance of using NaN values rather than 0 to avoid the possibility of our findings being nullified and our research papers retracted.</p>
<p>2. Something that surprised me was how even researchers with published work manage to make such critical mistakes in their research because of simple misunderstandings of how to manipulate and analyze data. I also want to know if there is any use for covariance if it seems that it is not a good measure of correlation.</p>
