<p>The most important takeaway from this class, and although its been brought up multiple times throughout the course so far, is that simple models, which in this example would be the normal distribution, work well in some fields like physics, chemistry or mathematics. However in regards to data science, there are often too many variables and "noise" in the real world that you can't just apply mathematical equations to solve issues. Like you said in lecture, no employer or company will pay you to just calculate the mean or do something a simple AI can do. In terms of the content of the lecture, correlation and its application and more importantly restrictions in use was an important concept to me. For example, correlation only applies to linear relationships even if there is technically a "correlation" in the datasets was something I didn't realize but is essential in understanding the relationship between data.</p>
<p>I would definitely learn to learn more about more practical applications or even toy examples of the aleatory calculations. That was the visualization that really helped me piece together the usefulness of correlation in comparing different datasets. The example of datasets having a r = 0.2 essentially meaning that there were 8 independently shifting gears with 2 gears in common between the datasets solidified how it could be and is applied. However I would definitely like to see more applications as examples are my favorite segment of the course and lecture thus far.</p>
