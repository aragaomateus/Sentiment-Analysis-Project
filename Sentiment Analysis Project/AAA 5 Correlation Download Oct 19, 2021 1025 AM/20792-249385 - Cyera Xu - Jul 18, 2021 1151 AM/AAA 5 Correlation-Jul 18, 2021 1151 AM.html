<p>1) For me, most of the lecture was a review of the normal distribution and correlation, which I found very very helpful. I think it was my first time knowing the Q-score (and I like that Jeff Bezos' height/wealth example). The linear algebra parts are still very hard to understand. <br />2) I really wanna know if there was one game at all in the casino that could be considered fair for the player (not counting the part that th casino has "big pocket.")</p>
