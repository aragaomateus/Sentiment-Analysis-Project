<p>1) The main takeaway from the lecture are normal distriution is the most commonly distribution we can find in the life, and it tells us how spread of the data lays and how far from the data within the given SD and Mean. Covariance is the transformation from the variance, but due to it's hard to interpret, we use covirance divide by the SD of the variables, we can get correlation, which is normalied covirance. So any number within correlation would between 1 and -1. correlation only measure the linear relationship. Correlation does not imply causation. Becasue correlation only measure between two variables, but in real life, there are more than two variables and things are complicated.</p>

<p>2). I would like to know more about how do we measure things have more than two variables? What methods do we use? Are we seperately mesure the relationship between each two variables? Finding a causality is hard, but what circumstances that reserchers or scientists are comfortable to say there are the strong causality? What criterias do they need to declear causality?&nbsp;</p>
