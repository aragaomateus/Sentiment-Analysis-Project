<p>Correlation is a difficult concept for me to fully understand. My biggest takeaway in this class is being able to understand how correlation represent the relationship of the variables through the scatter plot. As a visual learner, I always appreciate those charts and graphs you show on the lecture slides (especially the one that shows how covariance characterizes data clouds).</p>
<p>I would love to learn more about the linear algebra approach to covariance. I believe that I'm able to use that approach in calculations, but I still can't fully understand the rationale behind it since linear algebra is a new concept to me.&nbsp;</p>
