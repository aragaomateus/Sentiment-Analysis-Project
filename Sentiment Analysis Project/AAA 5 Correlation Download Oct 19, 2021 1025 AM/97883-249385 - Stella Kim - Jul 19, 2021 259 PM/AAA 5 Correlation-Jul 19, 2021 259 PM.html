<p>1) In this class, I learned about coding and reviewed statistical terms like the normal distribution. I learned about ergodicity and the law of large numbers and it was fun when the professor used our school tuition as the game prize. I also reviewed the correlation, variance, and covariance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I realized that I forgot a lot of statistical terms that I have learned before, so will practice by myself. The coding part at the beginning of class was understandable, as I learned how to do NumPy function.&nbsp;</p>
