<p>The main takeaway from the lecture session is the properties and usages of correlation, which tells us how strong certain matters or events are associated with one another. Correlation is very important in data science and provides us many insights before we conducted data analysis. In addition, I found the codes discussed in the lab session very useful, especially the part that described how we can manipulate a matrix to perform matrix operations. In the past, I used a list to create a matrix and operate it using nested for loops. Now using array and those codes I can perform matrix operations more effectively.</p>
<p>However, I found I have difficulty understanding the difference between variance and covariance first time in the lecture session. I hope we can spend more time discussing it. Also, I think it might be good to mention some codes about finding correlation coefficients and plotting correlation plots in the lab session.&nbsp;</p>
