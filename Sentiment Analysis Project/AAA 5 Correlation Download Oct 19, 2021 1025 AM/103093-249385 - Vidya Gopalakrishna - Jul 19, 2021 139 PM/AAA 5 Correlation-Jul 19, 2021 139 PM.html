<p>In terms of the takeaway, a lot of the material had been covered in the Data Science for Everyone course, which I had taken in the previous semester, or also in data analysis. It was still a great refresher to learn more about what's going to be covered and more applicable topics in relation to Data Science. The example describing normal distribution specifically talking about heights, really helped refresh the concepts in my brain. I also found it really beneficial to be able to connect correlation to how they are being used in other fields but also in Data Science.</p>
<p>I would love to learn more about more advanced concepts in terms of how correlation is used. Similarly, I would love to hear more about about the uses of covariance. I would also love to learn more about correlation and covariance real world applications. I think besides that, I dont really have anything else that I would like to learn more about.</p>
