<p>1. I found that the relation between Correlation and Covariance to be quite interesting, especially the math behind both. The conclusion I got from that class was that the main reason we have numbers like the Mean &amp; Median is because to set forward the basics for a correlation in studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The math, again was interesting; however, it still remained quite confusing to me in regards to how it's applied, I'd like to know more, but I feel that it's still pretty scant in my understanding, and I will definitely have to rewatch this lecture to understand more.&nbsp;</p>
