<p>1. This lecture gave me a rich appreciation towards data science. It is imperative to have clear understanding of the measures of central tendency and dispersion in order to know when to apply them on any given situation. The principle of the normal distribution which states that if something is normal, extremes are extremely unlikely resonated with me because it explains many natural phenomena like blood pressure, IQ measure, and height. Additionally, the factors of normal decisions which focuses on having lots of factors combined independently will strengthen my ability to apply this tool adequately. I found a principle of data science, which states that data science is all about relationships between data points and variables, particularly intriguing and powerful one that I will use for my engineering career. I also understand this powerful engine will provide a deeper understanding of regression and dimension reduction; tools that will be useful to interpret data and make predictions.</p>
<p>2. What surprised me the most was how you explained correlation using the Operation Market Garden Allied plan as an example. In doing so, you gave me an even richer understanding on the concepts of standard deviation, normal distribution, and correlation. I should also mention that I found the pegboard illustration very appealing.&nbsp;</p>
