<p>Q about sth that stuck out to me: how might one extrapolate meaningful relationships about data that seem to cluster around a singular point (as shown in the example during lecture)? Is there a formula for that (is a formula even necessary?), just as solving for covariance/correlation equations are useful for describing linear relationships?</p>
<p>I appreciate having the lab section before the lecture. I think I'm better able to pay attention to the coding workshops this way.</p>
