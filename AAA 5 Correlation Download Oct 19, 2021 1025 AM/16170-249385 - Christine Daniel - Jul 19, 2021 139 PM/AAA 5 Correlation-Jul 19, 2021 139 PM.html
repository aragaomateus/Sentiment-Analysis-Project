<p>1) Correlation Is just another way to portray relationships between variables- a single number is describing this. Normal distributions are the manifestation of ending up or adding up a certain location, and I have never looked at it that way. But once I understand that its ending up at a certain point after adding/combining a lot of independent factors. This lecture stressed the importance of really understanding correlation because relationships impact everything so understanding it will allow me to relate it to many techniques and methods within the curriculum.</p>

<p>2) What surprised me is how a correlation of zero does not mean there is no relationship ship, but when there is no relationship the correlation will be zero. I would like to learn more about this through visuals, because usually its just a blurb or extremely scattered plot, so then it will be hard to make assumptions about the relationship between the two variables?</p>
