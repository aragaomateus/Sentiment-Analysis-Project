<p>The main takeaway that I have form this class is that majority of things in life are reflected in a normal distributed format, meaning that there are ways of quantifying the chances of things throughout life happening. It shows me how if there is a situation that falls within that normal distribution, then it could be reflected in a quantitative format of this sort. With multiple independent factors combining together, it would be very easy to reflect this using this type of graph.<br /><br />What I would like to know more about is how to take a situation and analyze how it would be distributed in a graph. I know it was stated that 60% of life events are shifted in a normal distributed format, but how are we able to tell that with other situations?</p>
