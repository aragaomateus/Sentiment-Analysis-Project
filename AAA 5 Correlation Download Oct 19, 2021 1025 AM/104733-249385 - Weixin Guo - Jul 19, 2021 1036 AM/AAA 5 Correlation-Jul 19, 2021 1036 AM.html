<p>The main takeaway I have from this session is how we could visualize correlation as spinning gears that produce random numbers that we used when Pascal explained probability. I have never thought correlation as having anything to do with probability, since the way I learnt correlation is from a pure statistics course and from basic data science where correlation simple represent the relationship between two variables. However, now with Pascal&rsquo;s metaphor, I could visualize correlation as composed of two groups of spinning gears&mdash;ones that I only look at and record after the first spin for the first variable, and ones that I spin again randomly to generate new results for the second variable. In this case, the part of the correlation that deviate from 1 or -1 could be represented by chance. After today&rsquo;s class, I could visualize correlation, think about it faster, and talk about correlation more confidently.</p>
<p>I would like to know more about more examples where prefect correlations don&rsquo;t represent casualty. This really surprises me, since I thought perfect correlation could prove causality. However, Pascal showed me that this is not the case in non-linear relationships, which is something I have not learned much about.</p>
