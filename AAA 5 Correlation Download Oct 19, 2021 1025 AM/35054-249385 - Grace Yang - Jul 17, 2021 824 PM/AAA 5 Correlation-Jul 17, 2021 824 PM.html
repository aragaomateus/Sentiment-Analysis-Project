<p>1. In this lecture, I learned that correlation is a single number that captures the relationship between two datasets, but they only suggests a linear correlation. I particularly like the example of aleatory calculations using gears since it's an intuitive way to interpret the strength of correlation.&nbsp; I also appreciate the importance of correlation and why we should go one step further to normalize covariance to correlation. The final caution against confusing correlation with causality is not trivial at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If it is possible, in terms of the weekly quizzes, could you please reveal the grade and give us a hint of which question we get wrong after each time we submit an attempt?</p>
