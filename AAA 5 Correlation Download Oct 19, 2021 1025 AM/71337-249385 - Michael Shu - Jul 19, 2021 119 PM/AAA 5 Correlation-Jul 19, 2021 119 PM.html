<p>The Pachinko board example was very good. I never thought about why it creates a normal distribution until you pointed out how many ways a ball can get to a certain peg, and how at the edges you have to continually get on the right/left of the peg, while in the middle there's many more. Also, it helped to think of each peg as an event, and that the distribution was a result of the ball smacking into all of them, creating numerous independent events. The gear thing was useful as well. I've always thought of correlation as the slope of a line, but it's feels more practical to think of it as 10 or so gears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to know more about when to actually use correlation because I know there's a lot of things out there that can be abused, like for instance I'm pretty sure there's a fairly strong correlation between the number of movies that Nick Cage starts in and the number of terrorist attacks, or something like that. Correlation is fairly abusable and easy to create, so its use seems limited at best. So, I'd like to hear some "toy examples" or uses of correlation in general.&nbsp;</p>
