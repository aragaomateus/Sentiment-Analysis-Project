<p>1) I liked the example about ergodicity at the beginning of the lecture, I thought that it was very intuitive and easy to understand. I also thought that the explanation on normal distributions and how they aren't applicable in some fields was very insightful, which was something that isn't really talked about in statistics courses. I also haven't thought about *why* it is important to normalize the covariance by the standard deviations in order to obtain the correlation index, so I found that very informative as well. The emphasis on the fact that a correlation of zero does not conclude that there is no relationship was also something that I haven't thought of.</p>
<p>2) I think it would be great to talk more about aleatory calculations and how they relate to correlation. I got the example with the gears, but I didn't really get how that example ties back into the discussion on the strength of correlations.&nbsp;</p>
