<p>My major takeaway is that correlation doesn't guarantee causality. Correlation is a statistical relation between two variable. I can take any two variables I want and calculate the correlation. But it doesn't mean these two variables are causally linked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can correlation expand to multiple variables?</p>
