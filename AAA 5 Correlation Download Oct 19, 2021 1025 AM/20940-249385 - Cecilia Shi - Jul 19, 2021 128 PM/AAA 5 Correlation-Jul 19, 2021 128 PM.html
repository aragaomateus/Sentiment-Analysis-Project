<p>1.) Correlation is the concept that much of data science relies on, including regression and dimension reduction.&nbsp; Simple pearson's r correlations describe linear relationships and are usually seen via scatter plots, though other types of relationships are not as easily represented with a pearson's r.&nbsp; Correlation also doesn't account for missing or confounding variables which can bias interpretations.</p>
<p>2.) How can non linear relationships be characterized in terms of strength?&nbsp; Also, what can data scientists do to account for missing variables in experiments or studies when it may not be easily understood what is missing or confounding the data?</p>
