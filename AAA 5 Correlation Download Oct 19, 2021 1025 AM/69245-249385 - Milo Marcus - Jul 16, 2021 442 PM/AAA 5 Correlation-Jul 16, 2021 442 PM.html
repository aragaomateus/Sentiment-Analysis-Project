<p>1) I was a bit overwhelmed by the lab portion specific related to the stats portion, will be going to office hours to clarify. I enjoyed deriving the correlation formula and especially the WW2 example :). I am clear on how to use and derive the equation. I liked how we did these in a linear algebra was as well as it gave some of the previous things we had been learning a bit more meaning and gave me personally a glimpse into how these techniques and equations can be translated to large datasets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)I would like more of a clarification on correlation, what confused me was where that line comes from in which we measure the point against. (if they are both under it is -1, if they are both above it is +1.) where does that line that represents 0 come from? It was mentioned but I am still a bit confused.&nbsp;</p>
