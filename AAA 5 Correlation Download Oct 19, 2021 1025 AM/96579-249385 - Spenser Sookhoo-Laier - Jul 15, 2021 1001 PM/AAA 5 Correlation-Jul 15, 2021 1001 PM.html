<p>1. My main takeaway from this session is that we use correlation, which is a normalization of covariance, to try to identify the relationship between two variables. However, this parameter is limited in its capability because it only reflects linear relationships. Thus, relationships which aren't random and also aren't linear won't be well represented by this parameter. Furthermore, we must recognize that a strong correlation does not always signify causality; it's important to be aware of other potential variables which can impact the specific ones being examined.</p>
<p>2. I'm a bit curious as to what covariance is used for, aside from finding correlation. Considering it's difficult to interpret covariance without normalization, does it have any uses other than as a transitional point to find correlation?</p>
