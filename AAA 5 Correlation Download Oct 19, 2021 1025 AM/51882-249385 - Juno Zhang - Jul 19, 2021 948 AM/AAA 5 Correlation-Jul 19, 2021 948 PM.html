<p dir="ltr">LECTURE 5<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We used the Golden ball example to show how the normal distribution comes from and why it is &ldquo;natural.&rdquo; In my previous knowledge, correlation just described the relationship between two variables, but now I understand that it is a model to handle variation. I really enjoy deriving the correlation from SD, it connects all the previous knowledge. It is surprising to know the correlation is a normalized covariance. The linear algebra course I took only included the calculation part, but now I learned how to apply this to derive the correlation. I also like to know about the Operation Market Garden in WW2, which extends my history knowledge.<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the aleatory calculations, I am a little confused about why we can know the correlation r when we fix a gear.&nbsp;</p>
