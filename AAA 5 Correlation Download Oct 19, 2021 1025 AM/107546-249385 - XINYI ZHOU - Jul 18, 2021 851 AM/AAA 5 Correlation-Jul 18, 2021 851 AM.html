<p>In the lab section, I learned how to use Python to perform some linear algebra calculations and to obtain random numbers, and perform stimulation. For large amounts of data, it is difficult to achieve these results by hand. I am deeply impressed by how Python can help us with gaining statistical results. At the beginning of the lecture, I have a better understanding of the four "chords" of descriptive statistics learned in the last lecture by knowing why we need to calculate them. I have learned how normal distribution comes from and what is normally distributed and what is not in real life. More importantly, I have learned that the probability of extreme values in the normal distribution is extremely small and almost impossible. It was something I had never noticed or thought about before. In the previous study, variance, covariance, and correlation were explained separately. In this lecture, the explanation and derivation from variance to covariance and then to correlation is in a very orderly manner, which enabled me to build a frame diagram of their relationship in my mind and further understand their relationship.</p>
<p>I have learned covariance and correlation before, but I never knew that they can be obtained through linear algebra, which surprised me a lot and was such a great gain from this lecture. Although I have learned Pascal's triangle and normal distribution before, I have never thought that Pascal's triangle would have something to do with how normal distribution comes from. I hope to learn more about the origin and history of definition, distribution, and so on in future lectures.</p>
