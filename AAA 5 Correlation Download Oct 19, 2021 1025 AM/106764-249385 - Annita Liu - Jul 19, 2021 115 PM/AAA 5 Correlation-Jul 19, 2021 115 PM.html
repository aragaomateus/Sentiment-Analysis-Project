<p>I like the opening of the lecture with the discussion in normal distribution. As I learned from high school statistics class, normal distribution is the most common distribution in science fired, and distributed symmetrically. It should satisfy two assumptions: the variables are independent and the sample size should be large enough. The point I define as my main takeaway and the most funny but evident part in normal distribution is that with the normal distribution and the mean, we could tell what kind of events are impossible to happen since it is too far away from the distribution. Although I have learned normal distribution from high school, I didn't realize this important information it could reflect. Besides mean and standard deviation which could only represent one variable, correlation could help us to find the relationship in two variables. It is between 1 and -1, and only shows the linear relationship between two variables. Therefore, even if two variables are deterministic but there is no linear relationship, the correlation will be 0. Also, we should not view or expect that there is a causation between the two variables. I really like the way professor used to explain the 3 steps to find correlation with the Market Garden example. It gives me a more vivid and straightforward view on the logistic of correlation. First we need to square the standard deviation to find variance. Then, we have to find the covariance of the two variables. Lastly, we should normalize the covariance to find the correlation. Although I cannot explicitly explain the normalize process in words, I see the magic or the charm about how to substitute the matrix that helps us find the product of the standard deviations. This is the most shocking part I gain from this lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know we might have no time to talk about the normalization process of correlation again in the lecture. But I'm truly interested about it. If there is a chance we could put some relevant paper or Youtube videos about it, so we could learn more about it after the lecture.</p>
