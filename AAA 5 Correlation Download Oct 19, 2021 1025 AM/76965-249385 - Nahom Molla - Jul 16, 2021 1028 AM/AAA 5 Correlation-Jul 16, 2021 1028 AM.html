<p>The main thing I took away from this class was the fact that correlation between different datasets doesn't necessarily explain a cause and effect relationship. Another main takeaway I had from this class was the importance of using loops to avoid repetition and defining functions instead of reusing code. Overall, the session was very clear and I understood what went on.</p>
<p>I would like to see more hands on model building examples in the labs and homeworks. The last two coding homeworks were pretty similar. I want to see more examples with real-life data.</p>
