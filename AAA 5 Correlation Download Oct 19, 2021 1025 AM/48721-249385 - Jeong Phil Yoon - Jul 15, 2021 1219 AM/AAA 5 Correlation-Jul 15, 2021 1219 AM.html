<p>1) The normal distribution is the most common distribution around us, the human height distribution being the most common example of this. The way the normal distribution behaves is extremely helpful in making predictions as it shows the possible paths to a given location. This is because only two parameters are used to describe it. Correlation is key as it describes relationships and is the underlying technique to understand regression and etc. It is important to understand relationships as it is rare for an element to have an absolute value of some natural constant. However, correlation does not mean causality. Because it is just a statistical link between two variables and does not describe direction or which variable influences the other.</p>

<p>2) I was surprised by the utilization of Linear Algebra in computing variance, covariance and correlation. However, I was curious about what properties of correlation was it to compute it that way regarding the C star matrix.</p>
