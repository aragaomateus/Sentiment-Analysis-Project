<p>1) My main takeaway from Wednesday's class is the importance of correlation in data science. Oftentimes, people mistake correlation with causation, which can be both detrimental and costly. One thing that I found fascinating is correlation's ability to capture the relationship between two datasets and variables with a single number. The wheel turning scenario was really helpful because it was a great visualization of correlations and how to calculate them. Another important takeaway I had was how correlation only measures linear relationships. Just because a relationship is non-linear (and r=0) does not mean there is no relationship (like the sine and circle examples)</p>
<p>2) I am still a bit confused about the normalization of standard deviation with linear algebra. I have been exposed to very little Linear Algebra before this class, so the Linear Algebra interpretations were a bit confusing. Also, does bivariate correlation = covariance? I am a bit confused on that terminology. In terms of the lab, the blind archer problem was difficult to understand, but seeing that it is L-tier, that would make sense. I plan on rewatching the lab so I can get a better grasp of the code.&nbsp;</p>
