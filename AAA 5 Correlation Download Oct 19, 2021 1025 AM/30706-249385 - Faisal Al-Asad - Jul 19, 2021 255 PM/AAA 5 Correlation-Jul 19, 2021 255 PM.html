<p>The point of this lecture was to understand correlation and use it to understand the relationship between variables. We went about it by discussing various examples of that showed us what covariance looks like and then further what the mathematical derivation of that would be by translating the standard deviation into variance and then preforming work on that to get our result. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought the example of the balls dropping to be pretty amazing. It did a great job at showing the physical manifestation of the normal distribution. I will say I found the example of the neurons and visual stimuli a bit confusing but besides that everything was great this lecture to me.</p>
