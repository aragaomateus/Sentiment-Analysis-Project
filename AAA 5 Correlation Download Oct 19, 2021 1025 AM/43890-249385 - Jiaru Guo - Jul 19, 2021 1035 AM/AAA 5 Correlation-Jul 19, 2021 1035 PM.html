<p>1. The lecture went through the normal distribution and correlation. The relationship between correlation and causality reminds me of Spurious correlation, a term I learned from sociology class, which means "two uncorrelated and otherwise independent variables showing correlation, that cannot be rejected. The two variables are associated but not causally related, due to either coincidence or the presence of a certain third, unseen factor (confounder) ".</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; 1) I am confused about the "Why normalize by the product of the SDs " part (Slides IDS8, Page 24). Does it mean that after doing these calculations, we will get a matrix with 1s in the diagonal line and correlation of x and y in upper right and lower left side? The calculation is to prove that we will get the r(x,y) by normalizing covariance by the products of SDs. We don't need to know how to do the prove, right?</p>
<p>2) Aleatory calculations is introduced to show that correlation is everywhere but causality is hard to get, especially when variables get more. No need to pay attention to the data, right?</p>
