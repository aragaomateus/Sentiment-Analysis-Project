<li>My main takeaway was the derivation of distribution: specifically, that normal distribution is a physical manifestation of probabilities adding up. Correlation fits into the picture as a measure of relationships between parameters. Therefore, moving from measures such as the mean to correlation is a shift from thinking about one variable to considering two variables, and how they relate to one another. However, correlation does not imply causality and&nbsp; we cannot tell from a relationship which variable influences which.</li>
<li>I would like to know more about the section on aleatory calculations because I found the simulations helpful to my understanding. The most surprising thing to me was deriving the correlation step by step because I was able to see how standard deviation, variance, and covariance were related to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
