In the Galton board we were able to see that the pegs needed to combine independently and that there needed to be lots of pegs. But I am also wondering like, there also needed to be a lot of balls for the normal distribution to also come about surely because if there were 10 we might not have been able to see the distribution shape clearly. I also liked when you spoke about the human affairs example, and just to clarify I just wanted to make sure that you were saying human affairs do not follow a normal distribution because the events are no longer independent and we were able to see this through the Matthew effect. Another key takeaway is that if we knew a distribution is a normal distribution, then we know a lot of information b/c extreme outcomes are very unlikely (they are multiple standard deviations away).&nbsp; Mentioning the Q-score distribution was an interesting way to illustrate that not all distributions have a high probability at their mean. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another takeaway within this lecture is that 2 positively correlated variables don&rsquo;t imply causation because there can be a confounding variable or variables that is the cause for the correlations. This can be illustrated in the living by museums &amp; water example. Where the misinterpretation of correlation occurred.&nbsp; I enjoyed the linear algebra path to covariance. It was interesting to see how the matrix M just needed to be a matrix with two vectors of the same length for the covariance matrix to turn 2x2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was wondering if we could review why we needed to normalise the product of the stand deviations, I&rsquo;m not sure I entirely understood why the magnitude was not interpretable beforehand. I was also wondering if we could review the data cloud slide. I wasn&rsquo;t particularly sure as to why the diagonal quadrants (going from the bottom left quadrant to the top right quadrant) were positively correlated, while the other 2 were negatively correlated.</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 19, 2021 116 AM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Al-Asad, Faisal</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 19, 2021 255 PM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p>The point of this lecture was to understand correlation and use it to understand the relationship between variables.

<p>I thought the example of the balls dropping to be pretty amazing. It did a great job at showing the physical manifestation of the normal distribution. I will say I found the example of the neurons and visual stimuli a bit confusing but besides that everything was great this lecture to me.</p>

Covariance is the transformation from the variance, but due to it's hard to interpret, we use covirance divide by the SD of the variables, we can get correlation, which is normalied covirance. So any number within correlation would between 1 and -1. correlation only measure the linear relationship. Correlation does not imply causation. Becasue correlation only measure between two variables, but in real life, there are more than two variables and things are complicated.</p>

<p>2). I would like to know more about how do we measure things have more than two variables? What methods do we use? Are we seperately mesure the relationship between each two variables?

This lecture gave me a rich appreciation towards data science. It is imperative to have clear understanding of the measures of central tendency and dispersion in order to know when to apply them on any given situation. The principle of the normal distribution which states that if something is normal, extremes are extremely unlikely resonated with me because it explains many natural phenomena like blood pressure, IQ measure, and height. Additionally, the factors of normal decisions which focuses on having lots of factors combined independently will strengthen my ability to apply this tool adequately. I found a principle of data science, which states that data science is all about relationships between data points and variables, particularly intriguing and powerful one that I will use for my engineering career. I also understand this powerful engine will provide a deeper understanding of regression and dimension reduction; tools that will be useful to interpret data and make predictions.</p>
<p>2. What surprised me the most was how you explained correlation using the Operation Market Garden Allied plan as an example.

Normal distribution is common in daily life and and crucial in statistics, and it seems to be a magic function that given by the nature. Covariance is something I have heard a lot but never know how really works. It's more useful than I imagined. Correlation is important when describing relationships while correlation doesn't mean causation: there's the third variable that affects both. It's a challenge to the intuition and logic. The python part (lab) helps me know more efficient ways to obtain the mathematics goals. (but...)</p>
<p>When we know correlation isn't necessary causation...how can we really tell "causation"? When the two objects are correlated each other, and intuitively seem to be "cause" and "effect", how can we surely say one causes the other? Besides, I don't know whether it's my laptop's problem but python seems to be too jamming.

Oftentimes, people mistake correlation with causation, which can be both detrimental and costly. One thing that I found fascinating is correlation's ability to capture the relationship between two datasets and variables with a single number. The wheel turning scenario was really helpful because it was a great visualization of correlations and how to calculate them. Another important takeaway I had was how correlation only measures linear relationships. Just because a relationship is non-linear (and r=0) does not mean there is no relationship (like the sine and circle examples)</p>
<p>2) I am still a bit confused about the normalization of standard deviation with linear algebra. I have been exposed to very little Linear Algebra before this class, so the Linear Algebra interpretations were a bit confusing. Also, does bivariate correlation = covariance? I am a bit confused on that terminology. In terms of the lab, the blind archer problem was difficult to understand, but seeing that it is L-tier, that would make sense.

Note: This is not a summary. I know what I talked about. I want to know - in *your* words (paraphrased) - what *you* took from it, so I can assess two things: a) "What resonated with you?" b) "Did you get it?" 1 paragraph. Keep it brief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that resonated with me was how correlation and a deterministic relationship between variables is not the same. The sin and circle graphs show clear deterministic relationships between variables, but have 0 correlation. Furthermore, the idea of correlation not being causation made sense to me - I got it. The example of autism and organic food sales really drove this idea home. Confounding variables further drove home the idea that causation and correlation are no the same, so it is critical to understand how to ask questions about the data and if the correlation logically could be a causal relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) What would you like to know more about? This can be anything (material that you didn't understand well the first time around or new information that we didn't get to, but wish we had). If nothing: What surprised you? 1 paragraph. Keep it brief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to know more about modeling and finding deterministic relationships that are non-linear and not clear through correlation. For example, we can easily model the circle or sin relationships but correlation would not tell us this. Is there some other statistical measure for us to see if there is some clear deterministic relationship between variables? How can we model and analyze the strength of these relationships? Furthermore, I'm interested in how high noise to signal ratio changes the usefulness of correlation as finance has a high noise to signal ratio not often found in other areas where statistics is applied.&nbsp;</p>

Basically, aside from some fields in the scientific world, it is pointless to look for only absolute values and constants, since they aren't as common and as important as the relationships between these variables are. Since a lot of things in the world tend to be connected, it is important to notice these relationships in order to look for causality.

<li>My main takeaway was the derivation of distribution: specifically, that normal distribution is a physical manifestation of probabilities adding up. Correlation fits into the picture as a measure of relationships between parameters.

There are two views of bivariate correlation: classical view and linear algebra view.

The linear algebra view illustrates the two variables as vectors and the correlation associates with the dot product of the two vectors. This makes the product result in a higher dimension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I wished to learn more about is can we quantify the relationship between correlation and causation.

I have encountered with Normal Distribution previously. However, I feel like I finally better understand how amazing this distribution is. Even though it usually only works in field like physics or chemistry (or in nature generally speaking), knowing Normal Distribution lets me know lots of information, such as how unlikely extremes are going to happen. I never knew how in depth this is. Furthermore, the example of LTCM and Market Collapse in 2008 showed me how detrimental it can be to infer something by using wrong distributions. Also, I liked how that human affairs result in more extreme events and loved the example that explained Matthew Effect and Lollapalooza effect. Furthermore, this shows why normal distribution is unlikely to be used in the field like neuroscience, biology and economics. I now want to discuss about correlation. I have learned that I need to deeply understand the definition of correlation since it is used in many models and techniques that we will be using. Furthermore, I liked to learn that the reason why we use correlation is that it captures the relationship between two variables, and most science (outside of physics and chemistry) is all about learning relationship. I liked that we would likely to be using correlation instead of covariance, since it's unit free and possible to avoid confusion that can be misleading from unit differences. Also, I have learned the importance of knowing the difference between causation and correlation. Even though two variables are correlated with each other, it doesn't necessarily mean that one is causing the other because there might be unknown third or fourth variables that might be in this relationship. And, I understand how important to know this is because it can change entire meaning of this relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. I didn't quite get the concept of "strength" of correlations. Therefore, it would be really helpful if we could revisit that. Also, it would help me a lot if we could revisit on the one of the properties of the correlation, which is "a correlation of zero does not necessarily mean that there is no relationship, but if there is no relationship, the correlation will be zero.

Although I wasn't able to intuitively understand the linear algebra view of it due to lack of background, the classical view of steps made it clear for me to understand how covariance can be driven from the variance but using multiple variables instead of using same variable twice (which also helped relating the negative / positive direction of the covariance to the variance equation), and how correlation becomes interpretable by normalizing the covariance by standard deviation of each variables which are already standardized.</p>
<p>2) Since there are many relationships that are not linear in science or real life and we cannot use correlation to capture for them, what other parameters are there to capture relationships other than the linear relationships?

However in regards to data science, there are often too many variables and "noise" in the real world that you can't just apply mathematical equations to solve issues. Like you said in lecture, no employer or company will pay you to just calculate the mean or do something a simple AI can do. In terms of the content of the lecture, correlation and its application and more importantly restrictions in use was an important concept to me. For example, correlation only applies to linear relationships even if there is technically a "correlation" in the datasets was something I didn't realize but is essential in understanding the relationship between data.</p>
<p>I would definitely learn to learn more about more practical applications or even toy examples of the aleatory calculations. That was the visualization that really helped me piece together the usefulness of correlation in comparing different datasets. The example of datasets having a r = 0.2 essentially meaning that there were 8 independently shifting gears with 2 gears in common between the datasets solidified how it could be and is applied.

As I learned from high school statistics class, normal distribution is the most common distribution in science fired, and distributed symmetrically. It should satisfy two assumptions: the variables are independent and the sample size should be large enough. The point I define as my main takeaway and the most funny but evident part in normal distribution is that with the normal distribution and the mean, we could tell what kind of events are impossible to happen since it is too far away from the distribution. Although I have learned normal distribution from high school, I didn't realize this important information it could reflect. Besides mean and standard deviation which could only represent one variable, correlation could help us to find the relationship in two variables. It is between 1 and -1, and only shows the linear relationship between two variables. Therefore, even if two variables are deterministic but there is no linear relationship, the correlation will be 0. Also, we should not view or expect that there is a causation between the two variables. I really like the way professor used to explain the 3 steps to find correlation with the Market Garden example. It gives me a more vivid and straightforward view on the logistic of correlation. First we need to square the standard deviation to find variance. Then, we have to find the covariance of the two variables. Lastly, we should normalize the covariance to find the correlation. Although I cannot explicitly explain the normalize process in words, I see the magic or the charm about how to substitute the matrix that helps us find the product of the standard deviations. This is the most shocking part I gain from this lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know we might have no time to talk about the normalization process of correlation again in the lecture. But I'm truly interested about it. If there is a chance we could put some relevant paper or Youtube videos about it, so we could learn more about it after the lecture.</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 19, 2021 115 PM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Liu, Irene</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 19, 2021 1233 PM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p>Here are what I took from the class. If the experiment is repeated a lot of times, the average will converge to the expected value, provided that the system is ergodic. Normal distribution is characterized by a higher probability of values that centered around the mean; the probability of those values that are a few standard deviations away decreases exponentially. Correlation describes the extent to which two variables vary at the same time. The correlation will be zero if there is no linear relationship between the two variables. In addition, correlation does not imply causality, because there are factors outside the two variables that influence the relationship, and correlation might just be a derivative of the causal process.&nbsp;</p>

To summarize relationships with correlations we can use a normal distribution. A normal distribution results from having many factors combining independently. To derive correlation, we must begin with a distribution, find the standard distribution, convert to variance, convert to covariance, and then convert to correlation. The covariance characterizes the shape of a data cloud. A correlation can be thought of as a normalized covariance because it is normalized by the respective standard deviations. The correlation is represented by a single number that quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.&nbsp;</p>

My main takeaway from this session is that we use correlation, which is a normalization of covariance, to try to identify the relationship between two variables. However, this parameter is limited in its capability because it only reflects linear relationships.

<p>The main takeaway from this class session for me is that correlation is one of the most important numbers in data science as it captures the relationship between two variables and it characterizes how they covaries. I really enjoyed the beauty in mathematically deriving correlation (from beginning with the standard deviation of a distribution, to finding the variance, and then ending with the covariance). Moreover, seeing the linear algebra approach to deriving covariance exhilarated me. It made perfect sense to me because the goal of correlation is to quantify the linear relationship between two variables, which is one of the main purposes of learning linear algebra. Seeing the graphical representation of correlation helped me visualize the linear relations and understand the strength of correlations. Lastly, the most important takeaway is that correlation isn't causation, as its only a simple statistical relation between two variables!</p>

<p>One thing that I would like to learn more about is aleatory calculations. Seeing a different type of example other than gears to represents aleatory calculations would be helpful as when we went over it during the lecture I wasn't able to understand the specific importance of it.

It is unit-less, so one can compare across the correlations of different sets of variables in a dataset. Note that correlation doesn't imply causality--deciding causality is much harder and requires experiments--even when the correlation is perfect(abs value = 1). There might be a third variable that confound the causation of that two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As correlation only measures the linear relation strength, does the correlation of 0 mean that there is not linear relation but maybe other kind of relation, e.g. quadratic, logarithmic... ? Are there any parameters to be calculated for those kind of relation? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 16, 2021 343 AM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Yoon, Jeong Phil</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 15, 2021 1219 AM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p>1) The normal distribution is the most common distribution around us, the human height distribution being the most common example of this. The way the normal distribution behaves is extremely helpful in making predictions as it shows the possible paths to a given location. This is because only two parameters are used to describe it. Correlation is key as it describes relationships and is the underlying technique to understand regression and etc. It is important to understand relationships as it is rare for an element to have an absolute value of some natural constant. However, correlation does not mean causality. Because it is just a statistical link between two variables and does not describe direction or which variable influences the other.</p>

<p>2) I was surprised by the utilization of Linear Algebra in computing variance, covariance and correlation. However, I was curious about what properties of correlation was it to compute it that way regarding the C star matrix.</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 15, 2021 1219 AM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Yu, Yingying</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 16, 2021 1143 PM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p>The main takeaways from this session are the following: 1) Covariance depends on units, and dividing the product of SDs of x and y can help get rid of the units; 2) Correlation only captures linear relations, and there are other methods to present other relations (such as sine); and 3) Normal distribution is hardly the perfect model of subjects other than Physics and Chemistry.</p>
<p>The "data cloud" characterized by the covariance reminds me of the heatmap, is it depends on the covariance of two variable? are we going to talk about heatmap?</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 16, 2021 1143 PM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Zhang, Juno</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 19, 2021 948 PM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p dir="ltr">LECTURE 5<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We used the Golden ball example to show how the normal distribution comes from and why it is &ldquo;natural.&rdquo; In my previous knowledge, correlation just described the relationship between two variables, but now I understand that it is a model to handle variation. I really enjoy deriving the correlation from SD, it connects all the previous knowledge. It is surprising to know the correlation is a normalized covariance. The linear algebra course I took only included the calculation part, but now I learned how to apply this to derive the correlation. I also like to know about the Operation Market Garden in WW2, which extends my history knowledge.<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the aleatory calculations, I am a little confused about why we can know the correlation r when we fix a gear.&nbsp;</p>

The visualization of real world's complicated relationships was really impressive. Correlation could be found really easily, but its interpretation is more meaningful. High correlation cannot prove the causality. It reminds me of a famous example of the high correlation between eating steamed bread and going to the prison. It's not because people eat steamed bread that people go to prison, but because people go to prison that they can only eat steamed bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I used to be obsessed with the coin pusher, a kid's gambling game which have the same design principle as the pegboard.

The main takeaway I had from this class session was learning how normal distributions come to be. I especially liked the peg game simulation and Pascal's triangle explanation for understanding why normal distributions tend to happen. I also enjoyed the lab session where we could see the importance of using NaN values rather than 0 to avoid the possibility of our findings being nullified and our research papers retracted.</p>
<p>2. Something that surprised me was how even researchers with published work manage to make such critical mistakes in their research because of simple misunderstandings of how to manipulate and analyze data. I also want to know if there is any use for covariance if it seems that it is not a good measure of correlation.</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 14, 2021 730 PM</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AAAAAA><td colspan=2><font color=white><b>Zhu, Richard</b></td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td width=80% valign=top>AAA 5 Correlation-Jul 14, 2021 744 PM<p style='margin-top:3px;'><b>Comments:</b><br><p>1) I enjoy the coding aspect of this class and today's lab was no exception. Creating, transforming, and visualizing matrices that represent different statistical elements was interesting and fun to see. However, it was at the same time somewhat confusing. I come from a cs background and having taken up to CSO in the cs track, I am used to using OOP languages like Java and other languages like C and assembly. However, because Python is so different and utilized here in a totally different way, and also, seemingly much more powerful in terms of simplifying complex computations and visualizations, it can be hard to follow, especially when there isn't much time to comprehend the material during the lecture. Having time to digest the material beforehand would be a big plus and if Stephen could go into more depth, especially for less intuitive Python library functions, that would also be nice. In the latter half of the class, I found the derivation of covariance and correlation to be interesting as those were both terms I had learned in prior statistics classes, but never knew where they came from. Additionally, I found the peg board example that modeled a normal distribution to be very cool and it brought back childhood memories at the amusement park.</p>
<p>2) The thing that surprised me the most this lecture was how powerful NumPy is. I'm used to writing hundreds of lines of code for my cs projects. However, today's lab showed that with just a few lines of Python code, I could create accurate visualizations and graphs that would have taken a lot longer to do in any other language I know.</p></td><td valign=top><b>Submitted:</b><br>Jul 14, 2021 744 PM</td></tr></table></td></tr>
