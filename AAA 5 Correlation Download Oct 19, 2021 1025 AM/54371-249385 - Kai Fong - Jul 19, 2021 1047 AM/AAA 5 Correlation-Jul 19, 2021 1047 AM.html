<p>1) In-class code using concepts learned in class like MAD. Working with datasets. Also learned about datasets and concepts that apply to them and varying distributions with some review from Data Science for Everyone. A lot of usage with standard deviation.</p>

<p>2) We learned in Data Science for Everyone a lot of statistical dataset type information (p-values, r, r squared, etc.), and I'd probably want to see those concepts brought up again tied in with what we're learning now. I think right now is very conceptual (yes there are numbers involved but we're learning a lot of big ideas very quickly), but to see numbers and concepts go together in a topic like correlation.</p>
