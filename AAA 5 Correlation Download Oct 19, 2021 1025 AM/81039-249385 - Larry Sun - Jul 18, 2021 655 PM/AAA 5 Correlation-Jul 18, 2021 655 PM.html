<p>I will say the last session helped me to understand the correlation and distribution more profoundly. It gave me a sense that I should look at these indicators critically. For example, I can use the existing technique and distributions to analyze and do the forecasting, but I should not stop being critical about the results since the last session taught me to become critical when I use the model in order to avoid the problem in 2008.</p>
<p>I wish I would have more real-world examples of analyzing the performance of the model.</p>
