<p>Here are what I took from the class. If the experiment is repeated a lot of times, the average will converge to the expected value, provided that the system is ergodic. Normal distribution is characterized by a higher probability of values that centered around the mean; the probability of those values that are a few standard deviations away decreases exponentially. Correlation describes the extent to which two variables vary at the same time. The correlation will be zero if there is no linear relationship between the two variables. In addition, correlation does not imply causality, because there are factors outside the two variables that influence the relationship, and correlation might just be a derivative of the causal process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the linear algebra interpretation of the bivariate correlation. How can we determine the correlation after taking the dot product of the vectors?</p>
