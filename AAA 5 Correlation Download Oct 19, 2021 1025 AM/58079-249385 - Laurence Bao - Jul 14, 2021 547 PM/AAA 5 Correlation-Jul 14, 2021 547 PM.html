<p>1.) In this class, I took away the basics of correlation. I learned about the normal distribution through a really cool visualization (the ball dropping video) which really illustrated how one arrives at a bell curve distribution. In addition, several real world examples like the neuron example showed how correlation can mean/be different things in different fields as well as the importance of properly interpreting it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.) So in lecture, we went over why/how we normalize using the product of the standard deviations. However, I was a little confused about the matrix multiplication. Why did you essentially multiply from right to left in the example/derivation?</p>
