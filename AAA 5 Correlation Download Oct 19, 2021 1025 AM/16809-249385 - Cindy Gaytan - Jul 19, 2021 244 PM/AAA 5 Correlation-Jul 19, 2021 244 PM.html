<p>1.The takeaway is that normal distributions occur naturally in nature i.e. physics and chemistry. Another takeaway is that correlations are numbers between -1 and 1 that characterize the shape of a scatterplot and quantify the strength of a relationship between two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I would like to know more about how/why/when the normal distribution became acceptable to use in other fields, specifically psychology</p>
