<p>The main takeaway from this class session for me is that correlation is one of the most important numbers in data science as it captures the relationship between two variables and it characterizes how they covaries. I really enjoyed the beauty in mathematically deriving correlation (from beginning with the standard deviation of a distribution, to finding the variance, and then ending with the covariance). Moreover, seeing the linear algebra approach to deriving covariance exhilarated me. It made perfect sense to me because the goal of correlation is to quantify the linear relationship between two variables, which is one of the main purposes of learning linear algebra. Seeing the graphical representation of correlation helped me visualize the linear relations and understand the strength of correlations. Lastly, the most important takeaway is that correlation isn't causation, as its only a simple statistical relation between two variables!</p>

<p>One thing that I would like to learn more about is aleatory calculations. Seeing a different type of example other than gears to represents aleatory calculations would be helpful as when we went over it during the lecture I wasn't able to understand the specific importance of it. I would also like to learn more about complex correlation. This is because most of the time when studying a phenomenon in real-world applications there are a deluge of variables. Reviewing the topic of exploring relationships among several variable will help me concretely understand correlation and all of its use cases. Overall, I really enjoyed this lecture and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next lecture on Linear Regression.&nbsp;</p>
