<p>During this session I first revisited the concept of normal distribution, what I've learned more than before is the formula that derives this distribution and it enhanced my understanding toward the relationship between the parameters in the distribution. For the part on correlation, comparing to my former knowledges, I had a better understanding of the concept through learning how to derive the number through covariance, I also understand the nature of correlation more thoroughly through several vivid data models such as the gears and the dots and lines presented in this session.</p>
<p>For the upcoming classes, I would like to know more about how these statistical tools such as normal distribution and correlation connects to linear algebra as it was presented in this session. Also, it would be great if those explanations are accompanied with clear data models.</p>
