<p>1) The main takeaway is to understand how the correlation equation is able to quantify the relationship between two variables. In essence, we are computing the covariance to represent the relationship as either a positive or negative value and then normalizing the covariance to arrive at a single unitless value. The key idea is that correlation value is independent of both units and distributions. This allows us to interpret and compare the magnitude to other relationships. <br />2) I have a question about the algebraic derivation from the variance to covariance. Specifically, I don&rsquo;t understand the logic of substituting one of the (x(i) - mu(x) ) with (x(i) - mu(y) ). Isn&rsquo;t the point of squaring (x(i) - mu(x) ) to put more weights on the larger errors? So how does it make sense to replace that with (x(i) - mu(y) )? It seems almost like you&rsquo;re chugging some value and I don&rsquo;t see how the equation still makes sense.</p>
