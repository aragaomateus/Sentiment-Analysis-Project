<p>The main takeaway is that I learned about correlation, what does it measure, how to interpret, and how do we derive variance, covariance, and correlation one by one. These concepts are clear to me. My only question regarding this class's material is that sample standard deviation has a denominator of n-1. When do we use population std and sample std? Also, as I was doing the second quiz, I found I am still confused about SVD calculation, orthogonal and diagonal matrices and eigenvectors. Could you possibly review them sometime?</p>
