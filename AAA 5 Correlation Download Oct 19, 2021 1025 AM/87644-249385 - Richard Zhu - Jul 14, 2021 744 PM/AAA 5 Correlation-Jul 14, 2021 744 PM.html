<p>1) I enjoy the coding aspect of this class and today's lab was no exception. Creating, transforming, and visualizing matrices that represent different statistical elements was interesting and fun to see. However, it was at the same time somewhat confusing. I come from a cs background and having taken up to CSO in the cs track, I am used to using OOP languages like Java and other languages like C and assembly. However, because Python is so different and utilized here in a totally different way, and also, seemingly much more powerful in terms of simplifying complex computations and visualizations, it can be hard to follow, especially when there isn't much time to comprehend the material during the lecture. Having time to digest the material beforehand would be a big plus and if Stephen could go into more depth, especially for less intuitive Python library functions, that would also be nice. In the latter half of the class, I found the derivation of covariance and correlation to be interesting as those were both terms I had learned in prior statistics classes, but never knew where they came from. Additionally, I found the peg board example that modeled a normal distribution to be very cool and it brought back childhood memories at the amusement park.</p>
<p>2) The thing that surprised me the most this lecture was how powerful NumPy is. I'm used to writing hundreds of lines of code for my cs projects. However, today's lab showed that with just a few lines of Python code, I could create accurate visualizations and graphs that would have taken a lot longer to do in any other language I know.</p>
