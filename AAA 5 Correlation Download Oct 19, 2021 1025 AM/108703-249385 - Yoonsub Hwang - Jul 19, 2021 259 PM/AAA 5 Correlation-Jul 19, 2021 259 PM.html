<p>1) I first want to discuss about my intake on Normal Distribution. I have encountered with Normal Distribution previously. However, I feel like I finally better understand how amazing this distribution is. Even though it usually only works in field like physics or chemistry (or in nature generally speaking), knowing Normal Distribution lets me know lots of information, such as how unlikely extremes are going to happen. I never knew how in depth this is. Furthermore, the example of LTCM and Market Collapse in 2008 showed me how detrimental it can be to infer something by using wrong distributions. Also, I liked how that human affairs result in more extreme events and loved the example that explained Matthew Effect and Lollapalooza effect. Furthermore, this shows why normal distribution is unlikely to be used in the field like neuroscience, biology and economics. I now want to discuss about correlation. I have learned that I need to deeply understand the definition of correlation since it is used in many models and techniques that we will be using. Furthermore, I liked to learn that the reason why we use correlation is that it captures the relationship between two variables, and most science (outside of physics and chemistry) is all about learning relationship. I liked that we would likely to be using correlation instead of covariance, since it's unit free and possible to avoid confusion that can be misleading from unit differences. Also, I have learned the importance of knowing the difference between causation and correlation. Even though two variables are correlated with each other, it doesn't necessarily mean that one is causing the other because there might be unknown third or fourth variables that might be in this relationship. And, I understand how important to know this is because it can change entire meaning of this relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. I didn't quite get the concept of "strength" of correlations. Therefore, it would be really helpful if we could revisit that. Also, it would help me a lot if we could revisit on the one of the properties of the correlation, which is "a correlation of zero does not necessarily mean that there is no relationship, but if there is no relationship, the correlation will be zero. " I get the second part, but I don't quite get the first part of the sentence.&nbsp;</p>
