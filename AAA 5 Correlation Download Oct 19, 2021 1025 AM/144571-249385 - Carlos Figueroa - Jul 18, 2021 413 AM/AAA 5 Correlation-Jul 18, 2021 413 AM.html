<p>I think the main takeaway from this class, aside from the derivation of the standard deviation to obtain the covariance and then transform it into a normalized number called correlation, is the importance of the relationship's variables tend to have in the real world. Basically, aside from some fields in the scientific world, it is pointless to look for only absolute values and constants, since they aren't as common and as important as the relationships between these variables are. Since a lot of things in the world tend to be connected, it is important to notice these relationships in order to look for causality. And one of the most common forms of relationships between variables is a correlation, a linear relationship in two dimensions, which is the one we analyzed in this class while searching for a single number that could represent lots of information from a dataset.</p>
<p>I would like to know more about non-linear relationships between variables aside from clusters. For instance, in which scenarios can we find a pure sine relationship between variables? Moreover, can you explain the concept of the wheels and their association with correlation a little bit further than what you did in the class?</p>
