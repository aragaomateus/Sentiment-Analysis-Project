<p>Correlation is a very important concept in science since explaining a relationship between objects/theory is the basis of science. There are two views of bivariate correlation: classical view and linear algebra view. The classical view quantifies the linear relationship between the two variables, where the data point is two-dimensional. The linear algebra view illustrates the two variables as vectors and the correlation associates with the dot product of the two vectors. This makes the product result in a higher dimension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I wished to learn more about is can we quantify the relationship between correlation and causation. I think the relationship between correlation and causation is very interesting since it is a common misunderstanding that they can substitute for each other. However, they are two different concepts that relate to each other, but they are not completely the same.</p>
