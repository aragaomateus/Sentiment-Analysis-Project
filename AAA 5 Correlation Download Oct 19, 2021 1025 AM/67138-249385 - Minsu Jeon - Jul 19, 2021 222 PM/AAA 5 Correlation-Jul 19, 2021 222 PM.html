<p>1) The main takeaway from this lecture is knowing the steps of deriving correlation in the order of standard deviation, variance, covariance, and then correlation. Although I wasn't able to intuitively understand the linear algebra view of it due to lack of background, the classical view of steps made it clear for me to understand how covariance can be driven from the variance but using multiple variables instead of using same variable twice (which also helped relating the negative / positive direction of the covariance to the variance equation), and how correlation becomes interpretable by normalizing the covariance by standard deviation of each variables which are already standardized.</p>
<p>2) Since there are many relationships that are not linear in science or real life and we cannot use correlation to capture for them, what other parameters are there to capture relationships other than the linear relationships? (e.g. exponential) Also, where do we derive them from, if the standard deviations and variance also are invalid for those?</p>
