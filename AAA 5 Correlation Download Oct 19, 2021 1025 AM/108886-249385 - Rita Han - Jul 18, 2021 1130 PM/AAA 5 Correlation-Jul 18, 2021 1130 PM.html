<p>I learned about standard deviation and variance as well as correlation in my previous AP stats class, but we never talked about covariance. Therefore, it's new to me seeing how to get from variance to correlation through covariance (I also really liked the battle example). I also find the Aleatory calculation interesting and I think it helps me illustrate visually what a correlation is like. Following along the code and see those transformations and operations between matrix was also quite intuitive and helpful for me to understand the concept.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if there is any scenario that's useful to use covariance or is it just merely a tool or middle step to get to correlation? The connection between the normal distribution and Pascal's triangle is also a bit surprising to me and I would love to know more about it as well as Matthew effect. I'm also quite surprised by how different the simulation of the blinded archers turned out.</p>
